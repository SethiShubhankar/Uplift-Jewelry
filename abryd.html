                With a goal of achieving a greater social impact, Uplift Jewelry collaborates <br>
                with Abryd, a non-profit organization which aims to improve the quality of <br>
                education of children in rural Morocco. <br> <br>
                Construction for their most recent project, the building of a primary school <br>
                in a rural village named ...,, will begin March 1st 2021 and is estimated to be <br>
                completed by June 1st 2021. <br> <br>
                In collaboration with Abryd, the profits collected from the sale of Uplift <br>
                Jewelry rings from November 2020 to May 2021 will be used for the furnishing <br>
                of the newly built school. Profits will be used to purchase desks, to furnish the <br>
                teacher's room, any other classroom necessities and perhaps also to build a <br>
                sports or playground area.
